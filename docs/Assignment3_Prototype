A document explaining why you chose the technology stack that you are
demonstrating; I’d like to know if you considered other stacks, and the process you
used to choose the stack for the prototype. The doc should be added to your ‘docs’
folder on github.

Our group decided on a javascript technology stack. We are using Meteor.js to handle our server code and data layer. 
We are then using React.js to render html on the client. We chose this technology stack because it allows us to write the
entire program in javascript, which is simple and convenient. We are using React.js because it is widely used and has a 
great community. Meteor.js was chosen because it allows us to more easily create a reactive front-end experience and offers an 
out of the box publication subscription data communication layer using Distributed Data Protocal. We considered the MERN stack 
(Mongo Express React Node), but Meteor.js seemed like a cool framework that makes it easier to quickly prototype and iterate.
