User Story 1:

As a user of the web, I want to search for a “what to do plan” of my first day in Seattle.
I log in with the user name that I created two days ago.
In the search bar, I type in Seattle.
Voila~ 5 sightseeing places show up, along with 10 recommended restaurants nearby those places, from Italian to Chinese. 
It’s quite reasonable that the web recommends Museum of Pop Culture rather than Pike Market on such a rainy day. 
I choose 3 places among the 5 recommendations, and pick 2 restaurants. Then I click on the “Create my plan” button at the bottom of the page. 
Boomboomboom…
A detailed travel plan with transportation options/routes presents on the screen.
I save this travel plan in my bookmarks, and name it “YoYo Seattle”
During the day, I visit the Museum in the morning and have Chinese food for lunch. Somehow, I want to be more adventurous for dinner (i.e. not the burger I saved earlier).
I open the “YoYo Seattle” in my bookmark again, and click on the edit button next to the “XXX famous burger”. Options are: delete this event, change to a new restaurant, blahblahblah.
I change the burger thing to a Ramen Burger place. 

Engineer’s comment on the user story:
Include a login page. (Maybe third party login? That’s too detail)
Definitely there will be a search bar, key words are Locations
Return results of sightseeing places and restaurants using APIs
Have the option for user to make their combinations of the plan
Store the plan (database)
Enable user to edit the plan (query query query…)
